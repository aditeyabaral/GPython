# GPython
Recreated the popular graphing application "Desmos" on Python. GPython uses [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [numpy](https://numpy.org/) to create graphs based on functions. It is capable of solving differential equations and indefinite and definite integration.

# How to run?
Features can be tested by running:
```python <filename>.py```

# Dependencies
* matplotlib
* scipy
* numpy

#End Goal
GPython will run on a GUI and all equations will be supported for graphing.
